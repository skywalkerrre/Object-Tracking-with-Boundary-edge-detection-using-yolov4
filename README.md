# Object-Tracking-with-Boundary-edge-detection-using-yolov4
This  project  presents  an  advanced  computer vision system for object detection, classification, and tracking utilizing the cutting-edge YOLOv4 algorithm. Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in the accuracy and speed of object detection  models. The project focuses on training the YOLOv4 model on large-scale datasets with diverse object categories. By employing transfer learning techniques, the model will be fine-tuned to adapt to specific target objects of interest, achieving a high level of accuracy and generalization. The Object detection, classification and tracking model  achieves high accuracy in detecting and tracking objects. The performance analysis of the system showcases promising results. The model achieves the accuracy of over 95% for most of the objects, dropping till 75% for few objects and rarely till 50%. The fluctuation results due to the model not being very robust to occlusions. Overall, the model significantly improves the accuracy of existing model by detecting the targets that are very close to the edges of the frame to by focusing on them before they exit the frame. The model counts the objects and get their position  information  when  taking.
